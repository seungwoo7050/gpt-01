# [SEQUENCE: MVP8-1] MVP 8: Modern DevOps & Architectural Flexibility

## [SEQUENCE: MVP8-2] Objective
This MVP focuses on automating the development workflow and introducing architectural flexibility, demonstrating modern, professional development practices.

## [SEQUENCE: MVP8-3] Key Features
1.  **CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions):** Create a CI pipeline to automatically build and run unit tests on every push.
2.  **Container-Based Deployment:** Write production-ready `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` for local development, and Kubernetes (`k8s/`) manifests.
3.  **Lua Scripting Integration:** Integrate a Lua engine (e.g., Sol2) to allow for flexible, script-based modification of game logic without recompiling the server.
