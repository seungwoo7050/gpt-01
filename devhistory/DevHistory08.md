## MVP 8: Advanced World Systems

This MVP phase significantly expands the game world's capabilities, transforming it from a static space into a dynamic, immersive, and persistent environment. It introduces systems for managing multiple maps and instances, handling seamless transitions between them, and simulating environmental effects like weather and a day/night cycle. It also adds a dynamic spawning system to populate the world with life and improves core networking components.

### Map and Instance Management

#### `src/game/world/map_manager.h`
This is the central hub for managing all game maps, whether they are open-world zones or instanced dungeons. It loads map configurations and creates/destroys map instances as needed.
```cpp
// [SEQUENCE: MVP8-1] to [SEQUENCE: MVP8-13]
```

#### `src/game/world/instance_manager.h` & `.cpp`
This system manages the lifecycle of instanced maps like dungeons and arenas, including difficulty, reset schedules, and player lockouts.
```cpp
// Header: [SEQUENCE: MVP8-60] to [SEQUENCE: MVP8-70]
// Implementation: [SEQUENCE: MVP8-71] to [SEQUENCE: MVP8-72]
```

#### `src/game/world/map_transition_handler.h` & `.cpp`
This handler manages the complex process of moving players seamlessly between different maps and instances.
```cpp
// Header: [SEQUENCE: MVP8-27] to [SEQUENCE: MVP8-48]
// Implementation: [SEQUENCE: MVP8-49] to [SEQUENCE: MVP8-59]
```

### Dynamic World Systems

#### `src/game/world/spawn_system.h` & `.cpp`
```cpp
// Header: [SEQUENCE: MVP8-73] to [SEQUENCE: MVP8-81]
// Implementation: [SEQUENCE: MVP8-82] to [SEQUENCE: MVP8-87]
```

#### `src/game/world/weather_system.h` & `.cpp`
```cpp
// Header: [SEQUENCE: MVP8-88] to [SEQUENCE: MVP8-95]
// Implementation: [SEQUENCE: MVP8-96] to [SEQUENCE: MVP8-100]
```

#### `src/game/world/day_night_cycle.h` & `.cpp`
```cpp
// Header: [SEQUENCE: MVP8-101] to [SEQUENCE: MVP8-106]
// Implementation: [SEQUENCE: MVP8-107] to [SEQUENCE: MVP8-111]
```

#### `src/game/world/terrain_collision.h` & `.cpp`
```cpp
// Header: [SEQUENCE: MVP8-112] to [SEQUENCE: MVP8-118]
// Implementation: [SEQUENCE: MVP8-119] to [SEQUENCE: MVP8-123]
```

### Core System Improvements

#### `src/network/advanced_networking.h`
This phase also included improvements to the core networking layer, such as implementing a more reliable UDP protocol.
```cpp
#pragma once
// [SEQUENCE: MVP8-26] Reliable UDP implementation
// ...
```
