# MVP 5: Guild & PvP Systems

## Introduction

MVP 5 introduces large-scale social and competitive gameplay systems. This includes the framework for guilds, guild wars, and various Player-vs-Player (PvP) modes. A key challenge in this MVP was the discovery of missing source files (`GuildManager`, `GuildHandler`, `PvpHandler`) and legacy code that was incompatible with the established ECS architecture. 

This MVP documents the process of refactoring the existing systems, creating the missing files from scratch based on context from tests and other documents, and integrating the manager-style classes into the ECS framework in a pragmatic, hybrid approach.

---

## Component Refactoring (`ecs-realm-server/src/game/components/`)

The first step was to define and refactor the data components for all Guild and PvP-related state.

*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP5-1]` `guild_component.h`: Stores an entity's guild information, such as guild ID, rank, and war status.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP5-2]` `pvp_stats_component.h`: A data-only component for tracking a player's PvP statistics, including kills, deaths, rating, and seasonal data.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP5-3]` `match_component.h`: Defines the data for a PvP match instance.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP5-4]` `pvp_zone_component.h`: Defines a PvP-enabled zone in the world, including its rules and objectives.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP5-5]` `pvp_state_component.h`: Tracks an individual player's PvP state, such as whether they are flagged for PvP.

---

## Utilities (`ecs-realm-server/src/game/utils/`)

A helper utility was created for PvP-related functions.

*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP5-6]` `pvp_utils.h`: A utility function to convert a numerical rating into a displayable rank.

---

## Build Verification

After completing all the refactoring and implementation tasks for MVP 5, a full build and test cycle was performed to ensure the stability and correctness of the codebase.

### Build Process

The build process for MVP 5 follows the same procedure as MVP 4:

1.  **Install Dependencies**: From the `ecs-realm-server` directory, run `conan install .`.
2.  **Configure CMake**: Create a `build` directory, `cd` into it, and run `cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../conan_toolchain.cmake`.
3.  **Build and Test**: Run `make && ./unit_tests`.

### Final Build Result

*   **Execution Command**: `cd ecs-realm-server && conan install . && mkdir -p build && cd build && cmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../conan_toolchain.cmake && make -j && ./unit_tests`
*   **Build Result**: **Success (100%)**
    *   All libraries and executables, including the new handlers and tests, were built successfully.
    *   All unit tests passed, confirming that the guild and PvP features are working as expected.

### Conclusion

The successful build and test run confirms that the goals of MVP 5 have been met. The guild and PvP systems have been successfully integrated, and the project is now ready to move on to the next MVP.

## In-depth Analysis for Technical Interviews

#### 1. Architectural Decision: Why a Hybrid "Manager System" Approach?
*   **Problem Recognition:** The core logic for systems like Guilds or PvP matchmaking doesn't fit the main strength of ECS, which is processing large amounts of data sequentially every frame. Features like "Create Guild," "Send Duel Request," or "Declare War" are relatively infrequent, state-management-centric tasks that require simultaneous access to various data sources (player info, guild data, rankings).
*   **Pragmatism over Dogma:**
    *   **Limits of a Pure ECS Approach:** Implementing this logic in a pure ECS style would require numerous "tag components" to mimic a state machine (e.g., `GuildCreationRequestComponent`, `GuildCreationPendingComponent`) and many small systems to process them. This could make the overall logic flow harder to understand and potentially more complex.
    *   **Pragmatic Solution:** Therefore, this MVP makes the pragmatic decision to **"use the right tool for the job rather than blindly following an architectural principle."** This reflects a real-world development approach where delivering stable features on a schedule is paramount, demonstrating a mature focus on project goals over technical purity.
*   **The Hybrid Architecture:**
    *   **Data in ECS:** State directly related to individual players (e.g., `GuildComponent`, `PvPStatsComponent`) is managed as components in the ECS to maintain data consistency.
    *   **Complex Logic in Managers:** Complex business logic like guild creation/joining/leaving, matchmaking, and ranking management is delegated to manager classes (`GuildManager`, `PvPManager`) for centralized control.
    *   **The Bridge:** `GuildHandler` and `PvPHandler` act as adapters, receiving packets from the network and calling the appropriate functions on the manager singletons.

#### 2. Implementation Challenges
*   **Defining Responsibilities:** The most difficult part of this hybrid approach was setting clear boundaries for what the ECS systems should handle versus what the managers should handle. For example, activating a PvP state upon entering a PvP zone is handled by `OpenWorldPvPSystem`, while interactions like duel requests and acceptances are handled by `PvPManager`. If this boundary becomes blurred, the code becomes difficult to understand and maintain.
*   **Testing Complexity:** While pure ECS systems are relatively simple to test, manager classes, with their significant internal state, are more challenging. Testing `GuildManager` required writing unit tests for complex scenarios like creating a guild, inviting multiple players, and expelling a specific player.

#### 3. Future Improvements
*   **Clarifying Ownership:** The current managers are effectively singletons, allowing global access. While convenient, this creates challenges for testing and dependency management. If redesigned, these manager objects would be owned by the `World` class or a separate `ServiceLocator`. Systems or handlers needing a manager would then receive it via explicit dependency injection (e.g., `world->GetManager<GuildManager>()`). This would eliminate global state and make the system more robust and testable by clearly defining the dependencies of each module.
