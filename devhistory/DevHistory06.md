# [SEQUENCE: MVP6-1] MVP 6: Deployment & Production Systems

## [SEQUENCE: MVP6-2] Introduction
This MVP focuses on making the server production-ready. This involves creating a robust deployment pipeline using Docker and Kubernetes, ensuring database scalability, and implementing critical distributed systems components like a distributed lock manager.

## [SEQUENCE: MVP6-3] Deployment Systems
A comprehensive deployment pipeline was established to automate the building, testing, and deployment of the server.

*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-4] Dockerfile`: A multi-stage Dockerfile was implemented to create optimized, minimal runtime images.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-5] docker-compose.yml`: A Docker Compose setup for local development and testing, including all necessary services like databases, caches, and monitoring tools.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-6] k8s/`: Kubernetes manifests for deploying the application to a cluster, with support for different environments through overlays.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-7] scripts/deploy.sh`: An automation script for building and deploying the server to various environments.

## [SEQUENCE: MVP6-8] Database Scalability & Monitoring

*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-36]` `connection_pool.cpp`: Implements the `PooledConnection` and `ConnectionPool` classes, handling the core logic of acquiring, releasing, and managing connections.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-38]` `connection_pool.cpp`: Implements the `ConnectionPoolManager` and utility functions.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-41]` `cache_manager.h`: Defines cache-related enums (Status, Policy, Consistency).
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-42]` `cache_manager.h`: Defines the `CacheStats` structure for tracking cache performance.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-43]` `cache_manager.h`: Defines the `CacheEntry` template for storing cached items.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-44]` `cache_manager.h`: Defines the `CacheLayer` abstract base class for different cache implementations.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-45]` `cache_manager.h`: Defines the `GlobalCacheManager` singleton interface for managing all caches.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-46]` `cache_manager.cpp`: Implements the `GlobalCacheManager` methods.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-47]` `db_monitor.h`: Defines configuration and data structures for database health and query metrics.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-50]` `db_monitor.h`: Defines the `DatabaseMonitor` class interface.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-51]` `db_monitor.cpp`: Implements the `DatabaseMonitor` class methods.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-52]` `db_partitioning.h`: Defines partitioning enums and forward declarations.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-53]` `db_partitioning.h`: Defines the `PartitionedTable` class interface.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-54]` `db_partitioning.h`: Defines the `PartitionManager` class interface.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-55]` `db_partitioning.cpp`: Implements the `PartitionedTable` class methods.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-56]` `db_partitioning.cpp`: Implements the `PartitionManager` class methods.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-57]` `query_optimizer.h`: Defines the `QueryOptimizer` singleton interface.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-58]` `query_optimizer.cpp`: Implements the `QueryOptimizer` class methods.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-59]` `read_replica_manager.h`: Defines the `ReadReplicaManager` singleton interface.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-60]` `read_replica_manager.cpp`: Implements the `ReadReplicaManager` class methods.

## [SEQUENCE: MVP6-12] Distributed Lock Manager
A critical component for distributed systems was missing and has been created.

*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-13] src/core/distributed_lock/distributed_lock_manager.h`: Implements a distributed lock manager using Redis to ensure data consistency in a multi-server environment.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-14] src/core/cache/redis_connection_pool.h`: A placeholder for a Redis connection pool, a dependency for the distributed lock manager.

## [SEQUENCE: MVP6-15] 4. Advanced Concurrency: Lock-Free Queue
To enhance server performance and demonstrate production-level concurrency skills, a high-performance, multi-producer, single-consumer (MPSC) lock-free queue is implemented. This is critical for eliminating contention in high-throughput areas like the network packet pipeline.

*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-16] src/core/concurrent/lock_free_queue.h`: A header-only, template-based MPSC lock-free queue.
    *   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-17]` The core node structure for the queue.
    *   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-18]` Atomic head and tail indices for the ring buffer.
    *   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-19]` The underlying buffer for the queue nodes.
    *   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-20]` The `Enqueue` operation for producer threads.
    *   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-21]` The `Dequeue` operation for the single consumer thread.
    *   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-22]` Careful memory order management for correctness and performance.

## [SEQUENCE: MVP6-23] Secure Networking with TLS/SSL
To ensure secure communication between the client and server, TLS (Transport Layer Security) is implemented directly into the core networking layer. This encrypts all traffic, protecting against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-24] src/core/network/tcp_server.h`: The `TcpServer` class is modified to initialize a `boost::asio::ssl::context`. It will load the server's SSL certificate and private key from specified file paths. The constructor is updated to accept paths to these files.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-25] src/core/network/session.h`: The `Session` class is updated to use `boost::asio::ssl::stream<boost::asio::ip::tcp::socket>` instead of a plain `tcp::socket`. The `OnAccept` method in `TcpServer` will now create an SSL stream and perform the SSL handshake after a new connection is accepted. All read and write operations within the `Session` will now go through the encrypted SSL stream.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-26] CMakeLists.txt`: The `CMakeLists.txt` file is updated to find and link against the OpenSSL library (`libssl` and `libcrypto`), which is a dependency for Boost.Asio's SSL features.
