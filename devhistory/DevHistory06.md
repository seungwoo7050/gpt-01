# [SEQUENCE: MVP6-1] MVP 6: Deployment & Production Systems

## [SEQUENCE: MVP6-2] Introduction
This MVP focuses on making the server production-ready. This involves creating a robust deployment pipeline using Docker and Kubernetes, ensuring database scalability, and implementing critical distributed systems components like a distributed lock manager.

## [SEQUENCE: MVP6-3] Deployment Systems
A comprehensive deployment pipeline was established to automate the building, testing, and deployment of the server.

*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-4] Dockerfile`: A multi-stage Dockerfile was implemented to create optimized, minimal runtime images.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-5] docker-compose.yml`: A Docker Compose setup for local development and testing, including all necessary services like databases, caches, and monitoring tools.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-6] k8s/`: Kubernetes manifests for deploying the application to a cluster, with support for different environments through overlays.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-7] scripts/deploy.sh`: An automation script for building and deploying the server to various environments.

## [SEQUENCE: MVP6-8] Database Scalability & Monitoring
To handle a large number of players, the database architecture was designed for scalability and monitorability.

*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-9] src/core/database/partition_manager.h`: A manager for database table partitioning.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-10] src/core/database/shard_manager.h`: A manager for database sharding.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-11] src/database/db_monitor.h`: A comprehensive database monitoring system.

## [SEQUENCE: MVP6-12] Distributed Lock Manager
A critical component for distributed systems was missing and has been created.

*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-13] src/core/distributed_lock/distributed_lock_manager.h`: Implements a distributed lock manager using Redis to ensure data consistency in a multi-server environment.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-14] src/core/cache/redis_connection_pool.h`: A placeholder for a Redis connection pool, a dependency for the distributed lock manager.

## [SEQUENCE: MVP6-15] 4. Advanced Concurrency: Lock-Free Queue
To enhance server performance and demonstrate production-level concurrency skills, a high-performance, multi-producer, single-consumer (MPSC) lock-free queue is implemented. This is critical for eliminating contention in high-throughput areas like the network packet pipeline.

*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-16] src/core/concurrent/lock_free_queue.h`: A header-only, template-based MPSC lock-free queue.
    *   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-17]` The core node structure for the queue.
    *   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-18]` Atomic head and tail indices for the ring buffer.
    *   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-19]` The underlying buffer for the queue nodes.
    *   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-20]` The `Enqueue` operation for producer threads.
    *   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-21]` The `Dequeue` operation for the single consumer thread.
    *   `[SEQUENCE: MVP6-22]` Careful memory order management for correctness and performance.
