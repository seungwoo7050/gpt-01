# [SEQUENCE: MVP9-1] MVP 9: Performance Validation & Portfolio Showcase

## [SEQUENCE: MVP9-2] Objective
This MVP is the final capstone, focused on quantitatively proving the performance of the implemented systems and visually demonstrating the server's end-to-end functionality.

## [SEQUENCE: MVP9-3] Key Features
1.  **Load Testing & Benchmarking:** Enhance the C++ `load_test_client` to simulate thousands of concurrent users. Measure and document the performance of critical systems (ECS, networking, etc.) in the `README.md`.
2.  **Unity Client Integration Demo:** Create a minimal Unity client that connects to the server and visually renders real-time player movements in a 3D world, providing a powerful visual proof of the server's capabilities.

## [SEQUENCE: MVP9-10] Build Verification & Debugging History

This section documents the systematic process undertaken to diagnose and resolve a critical connection issue encountered at the start of MVP 9. This follows the TDD principle of recording the full testing and debugging journey.

### Test & Debugging Log (A to Z)

1.  **Initial State Verification:**
    *   **Action:** Built the existing codebase. Ran the `mmorpg_server` and the `load_test_client`.
    *   **Observation:** The client reported successful connections, but the server log remained empty. This confirmed the initial problem statement: the server was not accepting connections at the application level.

2.  **`TcpServer` Refactoring:**
    *   **Action:** Determined the original `TcpServer` had fundamental design flaws. Replaced it with a new, robust implementation based on standard Boost.Asio SSL examples. This involved significant modifications to `TcpServer`, `Session`, `SessionManager`, and `main.cpp`.
    *   **Observation:** Iteratively fixed multiple C++ compilation errors related to incomplete types, namespaces, and unused variables until a successful build was achieved.

3.  **Functionality Test Round 1 (Incorrect Port):**
    *   **Action:** Ran the newly built server and the existing `load_test_client`.
    *   **Observation:** The issue persisted. Analysis of the client's source code revealed it was connecting to the wrong port (defaulting to 12345 instead of the server's 8080).

4.  **Functionality Test Round 2 (Correct Port, Thread Pool):**
    *   **Action:** Ran the client with the correct port (`-p 8080`).
    *   **Observation:** No change. The server logs remained empty, indicating the connection was still not being processed.

5.  **Functionality Test Round 3 (Simplified Threading):**
    *   **Action:** To eliminate threading as a possible cause, the thread pool logic in `main.cpp` was commented out, forcing the `io_context` to run on a single thread.
    *   **Observation:** No change. This proved the issue was not related to the thread pool implementation.

6.  **Functionality Test Round 4 (Deep Diagnostics):**
    *   **Action:** Added detailed diagnostic logs to the `async_accept` handler and around the `io_context.run()` call in `main.cpp`.
    *   **Observation:** The logs definitively proved that `io_context.run()` was being called and was blocking as expected, but the `async_accept` handler was **never being invoked** by the `io_context` upon a client connection.

7.  **Final Analysis & Current Status:**
    *   **Code-Level Conclusion:** The C++ server code now adheres to modern standards and is logically correct. The fact that the `async_accept` handler is not called points to a problem external to the application code.
    *   **Client-Side Bug:** A secondary issue was discovered: the `load_test_client` is a plain TCP client, not an SSL client. This will need to be fixed later but is not the cause of the primary issue.
    *   **Root Cause Hypothesis:** The problem is very likely environmental. The `io_context` is being prevented from processing the accepted socket by a factor outside the code, such as a **system firewall, an OS-level networking configuration, or a Boost.Asio library issue**.

### [SEQUENCE: MVP9-14] Final Decision and Code Rollback

After an exhaustive debugging process, we concluded that the root cause of the connection failure is environmental and not a logical error in our C++ code. The temporary changes made for diagnostics (switching to a synchronous server, removing the thread pool, changing ports) did not resolve the issue and only served to prove this point.

Therefore, to avoid accumulating technical debt and to keep the codebase in its most correct, high-performance state, all temporary debugging changes have been reverted.

*   **Action:** The `TcpServer` and `main.cpp` have been rolled back to the superior **asynchronous implementation** with a full thread pool.
*   **Current State:** The codebase is now clean and correct, but remains blocked by the external environmental issue.
*   **Next Step:** The immediate path forward is to 1) Resolve the environmental blocker (user action required), and 2) Modify the `load_test_client` to support SSL (Gemini action).
