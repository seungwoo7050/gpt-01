# [SEQUENCE: MVP9-1] MVP 9: Performance Validation & Portfolio Showcase

## [SEQUENCE: MVP9-2] Objective
This MVP is the final capstone, focused on quantitatively proving the performance of the implemented systems and visually demonstrating the server's end-to-end functionality.

## [SEQUENCE: MVP9-3] Key Features
1.  **Load Testing & Benchmarking:** Enhance the C++ `load_test_client` to simulate thousands of concurrent users. Measure and document the performance of critical systems (ECS, networking, etc.) in the `README.md`.
2.  **Unity Client Integration Demo:** Create a minimal Unity client that connects to the server and visually renders real-time player movements in a 3D world, providing a powerful visual proof of the server's capabilities.
