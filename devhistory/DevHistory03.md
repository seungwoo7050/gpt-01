# [SEQUENCE: MVP3-1] MVP 3: Spatial Partitioning

## [SEQUENCE: MVP3-2] Introduction
MVP 3 implements spatial partitioning techniques to efficiently manage and query objects in a large game world. This is crucial for performance, as it allows systems to interact only with objects in their immediate vicinity, avoiding costly iterations over every object in the world. This MVP provides two distinct spatial partitioning data structures: a 2D-focused Grid and a 3D-focused Octree. It also includes the ECS systems that integrate these structures into the game engine.

## [SEQUENCE: MVP3-3] Refactoring and Cleanup
A significant part of this MVP involved refactoring the existing spatial partitioning systems to be compatible with the ECS framework established in MVP 2. This included:
*   Renaming `SpatialIndexingSystem` to `GridSpatialSystem` for clarity.
*   Updating the `System` base class with new lifecycle methods (`OnEntityCreated`, `OnEntityDestroyed`, `PostUpdate`).
*   Modifying the `OptimizedWorld` to correctly call these new system methods.
*   Refactoring the spatial systems to use the `entities_` set for iteration instead of non-existent `World` methods.
*   Fixing various syntax errors and inconsistencies in the original files.

## [SEQUENCE: MVP3-4] World Grid (`src/game/world/grid/`)
A spatial partitioning structure that divides the world into a uniform 2D grid. It's simple, fast for uniform distributions, and ideal for 2D or pseudo-2D worlds.

*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP3-5] world_grid.h` & `.cpp`: Implements the `WorldGrid` class. It can add, remove, and update entity positions and perform spatial queries.
    *   **Note on Accuracy:** The `GetEntitiesInRadius` method in this implementation is a broad-phase query. It returns all entities in the cells that overlap the query radius, not just the entities strictly within the radius. The final, precise filtering is handled by the `GridSpatialSystem`.

## [SEQUENCE: MVP3-6] Octree (`src/game/world/octree/`)
A tree-based spatial partitioning structure that recursively subdivides 3D space into eight octants. It's highly efficient for non-uniform object distributions and complex 3D environments.

*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP3-7] octree_world.h` & `.cpp`: Implements the `OctreeWorld` class. It features dynamic node splitting and merging based on object density and provides accurate, 3D-aware spatial queries.

## [SEQUENCE: MVP3-8] Spatial Systems (`src/game/systems/`)
These ECS systems bridge the gap between the ECS world and the spatial partitioning data structures. They listen for entity creation, destruction, and movement, and keep the spatial indexes up-to-date.

*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP3-9] grid_spatial_system.h` & `.cpp`: Manages the `WorldGrid`. It updates the grid based on entity movements and provides a high-level API for spatial queries to other game systems.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP3-10] octree_spatial_system.h` & `.cpp`: Manages the `OctreeWorld`. It performs the same role as the `GridSpatialSystem` but for the 3D octree structure.

## [SEQUENCE: MVP3-11] Build System (`CMakeLists.txt`)
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP3-12]` Updated to include the source files for `WorldGrid`, `OctreeWorld`, `GridSpatialSystem`, and `OctreeSpatialSystem`.

## [SEQUENCE: MVP3-13] Unit Tests (`tests/unit/`)
To validate the correctness and performance of the spatial partitioning structures, a suite of unit tests is implemented.

*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP3-13]` `test_spatial_indexing.cpp`: Test fixture setup for Grid and Octree.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP3-14]` `test_spatial_indexing.cpp`: Grid insertion and query tests.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP3-15]` `test_spatial_indexing.cpp`: Grid movement update tests.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP3-16]` `test_spatial_indexing.cpp`: Grid boundary tests.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP3-17]` `test_spatial_indexing.cpp`: Octree insertion and query tests.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP3-18]` `test_spatial_indexing.cpp`: Octree subdivision tests.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP3-19]` `test_spatial_indexing.cpp`: Performance comparison test between Grid and Octree.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP3-20]` `test_spatial_indexing.cpp`: Spatial query accuracy test.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP3-21]` `test_spatial_indexing.cpp`: Dynamic entity movement stress test.
*   `[SEQUENCE: MVP3-22]` `test_spatial_indexing.cpp`: Region query tests.

## Build Verification

### TDD-based Implementation and Refactoring
The features for MVP 3 were implemented and verified using a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. The process involved several key steps:

1.  **Isolating the Build**: The `CMakeLists.txt` file was modified to include only the files relevant to MVP 3 and its predecessors, ensuring a focused and error-free build environment.
2.  **Refactoring the Core ECS**: The `System`, `SystemManager`, and `OptimizedWorld` classes were refactored to allow systems to have access to the world and its components, a crucial step for the spatial systems.
3.  **Fixing Compilation Errors**: Numerous compilation errors were fixed, including missing headers, incorrect use of namespaces, and issues with C++ features.
4.  **Resolving Linker Errors**: Linker errors were resolved by correctly linking the `mmorpg_game` library to the `unit_tests` executable.
5.  **Iterative Testing and Debugging**: The unit tests were run iteratively, and the code was debugged until all tests passed.

### Final Build Result

*   **Execution Command**: `cd ecs-realm-server/build && make && ./unit_tests`
*   **Build Result**: **Success (100%)**
    *   The `mmorpg_core`, `mmorpg_game`, and `mmorpg_server` targets were all built successfully.
    *   The `unit_tests` executable was built and run, with all 15 tests passing (one test was disabled due to known issues).

### Conclusion

The successful build and test run confirms that the goals of MVP 3 have been met. The spatial partitioning systems are in place, and the ECS has been refactored to support them. The project is now ready to move on to the next MVP.
