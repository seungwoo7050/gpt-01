## Usage Example

```cpp
// Start crafting
auto& manager = FurnitureCraftingManager::Instance();
auto session = manager.StartCrafting(
    player_id, 
    recipe_id, 
    current_station
);

// Track progress
while (session->GetState() == SessionState::CRAFTING) {
    float progress = session->GetProgress();
    UpdateUI(progress);
}

// Get result
if (session->GetState() == SessionState::COMPLETED) {
    auto furniture = session->GetResult();
    player.AddToInventory(furniture);
}
```
