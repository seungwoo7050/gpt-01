# MVP5: Guild War Systems Implementation

## Summary
Implemented both instanced and seamless guild war systems as specified in subject.md. This corrects the previous MVP5 implementation which incorrectly implemented Arena PvP and Open World PvP instead of guild wars.

## Files Implemented

### Core Components
- `guild_component.h` - Defines guild membership and war participation

### Instanced Guild War System
- `instanced/guild_war_instanced_system.h` - Separate battle instances
- `instanced/guild_war_instanced_system.cpp` - Implementation with objectives

Features:
- War declaration with acceptance required
- Separate instance creation for battles
- Objective-based gameplay (5 capture points)
- Score-based victory conditions
- 20-100 players per side
- Teleportation to/from instance

### Seamless Guild War System  
- `seamless/guild_war_seamless_system.h` - Wars in main world
- `seamless/guild_war_seamless_system.cpp` - Territory control implementation

Features:
- 24-hour war declaration period
- Territory control in main world
- No instancing - battles in existing zones
- Resource generation from territories
- Multiple concurrent wars supported
- Dynamic capture mechanics

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Two Different Approaches**: Following subject.md requirement to implement ALL variations
2. **Instanced System**: Better for balanced competitive play, prevents interference
3. **Seamless System**: Better for massive scale, territory control, persistent world impact
4. **Guild Component**: Shared between both systems for consistency

## Technical Implementation
- Thread-safe operations for concurrent access
- Efficient spatial queries for territory control
- Proper state management for war phases
- Reward distribution based on participation

## Notes
This implementation fulfills the actual MVP5 requirements from subject.md. The previous PvP implementations (Arena and Open World) were incorrectly placed in MVP5 and should have been part of MVP4 or a separate MVP.
