# Phase 105: Tournament System

## Overview
This phase implements a comprehensive tournament system supporting multiple formats (single/double elimination, round robin, Swiss), automated bracket generation, scheduled events, and full integration with arena and ranking systems.

## Key Components

### 1. Tournament Formats (SEQUENCE: 2835)
- **Single Elimination**: Traditional knockout, one loss = elimination
- **Double Elimination**: Losers bracket for second chance
- **Round Robin**: Everyone plays everyone once
- **Swiss System**: Players with similar scores paired each round
- **Ladder**: Continuous ranking-based competition
- **Custom**: Flexible format for special events

### 2. Tournament Requirements (SEQUENCE: 2836)
```cpp
struct TournamentRequirements {
    // Rating requirements
    int32_t minimum_rating{0};        // e.g., 1500+ for competitive
    int32_t maximum_rating{9999};     // Cap for beginner tournaments
    
    // Experience requirements
    uint32_t minimum_level{1};        // Character level
    uint32_t minimum_arena_matches{10}; // Proven experience
    uint32_t minimum_win_rate{0};    // Quality filter (0-100%)
    
    // Entry fees (gold sinks)
    uint32_t entry_fee_gold{0};
    uint32_t entry_fee_tokens{0};
    
    // Team requirements
    uint32_t team_size{1};           // 1 for solo, 3 for team
    bool require_guild_team{false};  // Guild tournaments
};
```

### 3. Tournament Flow (SEQUENCE: 2849-2861)

#### Registration Phase
- Open registration period (typically 24-48 hours)
- Players sign up and pay entry fees
- Requirements verified automatically
- Refunds if requirements not met

#### Check-in Phase
- 1 hour before tournament start
- Players confirm participation
- No-shows removed from bracket
- Minimum participant check

#### Tournament Execution
1. Bracket generation with rating-based seeding
2. First round matches created
3. Arena matches run automatically
4. Results update bracket in real-time
5. Next rounds scheduled with breaks
6. Continue until champion determined

#### Reward Distribution
- Automatic reward distribution by placement
- Currency, items, titles, and achievements
- Rating bonuses for high placements
- Participation rewards

### 4. Bracket Algorithms (SEQUENCE: 2887-2889)

#### Standard Seeding
```cpp
// Prevents top seeds from meeting early
1 vs 16, 8 vs 9  (opposite sides of bracket)
4 vs 13, 5 vs 12 (quarter placement)
2 vs 15, 7 vs 10 (avoid early matchups)
3 vs 14, 6 vs 11 (balanced distribution)
```

#### Swiss Pairing
```cpp
// Pair players with same score
Round 1: Random pairing
Round 2+: Group by wins, pair within groups
Final: Top players determined by score
```

#### Round Robin Schedule
```cpp
// Efficient scheduling algorithm
- Each player plays every other player once
- Minimize wait time between matches
- Handle bye rounds for odd numbers
```

### 5. Automated Tournament Schedule (SEQUENCE: 2882-2884)

#### Daily Tournaments
```

- Time: 8:00 PM server time
- Format: Single elimination

```

### 6. Tournament States (SEQUENCE: 2850)
```cpp
enum class TournamentState {
    REGISTRATION,       // Accepting sign-ups
    CHECK_IN,          // Confirming participants
    BRACKET_GENERATION, // Creating matchups
    IN_PROGRESS,       // Matches running
    COMPLETED,         // Winners determined
    CANCELLED          // Insufficient players
};
```

### 7. Player Commands (SEQUENCE: 2872)
- `/tournament list` - View all tournaments
- `/tournament info <id>` - Detailed tournament info
- `/tournament register <id>` - Sign up
- `/tournament checkin <id>` - Confirm participation
- `/tournament standings <id>` - View bracket/results

## Integration Points

### Arena System Integration
- Tournaments create arena matches automatically
- Match results update tournament brackets
- Arena configuration per tournament

### Ranking System Integration
- Seeding based on current ratings
- Rating changes from tournament matches
- Bonus rating for tournament placements

### Notification System
- 30-minute warnings before tournament
- 5-minute check-in reminders
- Match ready notifications
- Results announcements

## Example Tournament Configuration

```cpp
// Weekly 3v3 Championship
TournamentConfig config;
config.tournament_name = "Weekly 3v3 Championship";
config.format = TournamentFormat::DOUBLE_ELIMINATION;
config.arena_type = ArenaType::ARENA_3V3;

// Schedule
config.registration_start = saturday - 48h;
config.registration_end = saturday - 1h;
config.tournament_start = saturday_6pm;

// Requirements
config.requirements.minimum_rating = 1500;
config.requirements.minimum_arena_matches = 50;
config.requirements.team_size = 3;
config.requirements.entry_fee_tokens = 10;

// Rewards by placement
config.rewards[1] = {1, 5000, 500, 100, {mount_id}, "Weekly Champion"};
config.rewards[2] = {2, 2500, 250, 50, {items}, ""};
config.rewards[3] = {3, 1000, 100, 25, {items}, ""};
// Top 8 get rewards...
```
