# Phase 118: Neighborhood System

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive neighborhood system with community features, plot management, neighbor interactions, events, and services for creating vibrant housing communities.

## Technical Implementation

### Plot Allocation Algorithm
```cpp
PlotAllocation AllocatePlot(player_id, house_type, preferred_type) {
    // Try preferred neighborhood type first
    for (auto& neighborhood : GetByType(preferred_type)) {
        if (auto plot = neighborhood->GetAvailablePlot(house_type)) {
            return {neighborhood, plot};
        }
    }
    
    // Fall back to any available
    for (auto& [id, neighborhood] : all_neighborhoods) {
        if (auto plot = neighborhood->GetAvailablePlot(house_type)) {
            return {neighborhood, plot};
        }
    }
    
    return {nullptr, nullptr};
}
```

### Neighbor Caching
```cpp
// Cached neighbor lookups with 5-minute expiry
vector<uint64_t> GetNeighborHouses(house_id, radius) {
    if (cache_valid) return cached_neighbors;
    
    vector<uint64_t> neighbors;
    for (auto& plot : plots) {
        if (Distance(plot) <= radius) {
            neighbors.push_back(plot.house_id);
        }
    }
    
    cache_neighbors(neighbors);
    return neighbors;
}
```

### Layout Generation
Three layout types:
1. **Suburban**: Grid with gardens
2. **Urban**: Dense with alleys
3. **Rural**: Organic placement

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Spatial Indexing**
   - Zone-based lookups
   - Grid partitioning
   - Distance caching

2. **Event Optimization**
   - Participant caps
   - Batch processing
   - Reward pooling

3. **Memory Management**
   - Lazy neighborhood loading
   - Shared feature data
   - Cache expiration

## Integration Points

### Housing System
- Plot to house mapping
- Property management
- Tax collection

### Social System
- Friend bonuses
- Guild neighborhoods
- Reputation tracking

### Economic System
- Property values
- Tax rates
- Market integration

### Event System
- Community activities
- Seasonal celebrations
- Contest management

## Usage Example

```cpp
// Create neighborhood
auto& manager = NeighborhoodManager::Instance();
auto neighborhood = manager.CreateNeighborhood(
    "Sunset Hills",
    NeighborhoodType::RESIDENTIAL,
    Vector3(1000, 0, 1000)
);

// Allocate plot for player
auto allocation = manager.AllocatePlot(
    player_id,
    HouseType::COTTAGE,
    NeighborhoodType::RESIDENTIAL
);

if (allocation.plot_info) {
    // Build house on plot
    BuildHouse(allocation);
}

// Start community event
auto& events = NeighborhoodEvents::Instance();
events.StartBlockParty(neighborhood->GetId());

// Record neighbor interaction
auto& community = CommunityInteraction::Instance();
community.RecordInteraction(player1_id, player2_id, "help");
```
