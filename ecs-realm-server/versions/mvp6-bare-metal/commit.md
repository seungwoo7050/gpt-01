# MVP6: Bare Metal Deployment Implementation

## Summary
Implemented bare metal deployment option for maximum performance on dedicated Linux servers. This completes the trilogy of deployment options (Docker, Kubernetes, Bare Metal) as required by subject.md.

## Files Created

### Main Deployment Script
- `deploy_bare_metal.sh` - Comprehensive deployment automation
  - OS detection and package installation
  - Build configuration with optimizations
  - Service setup with systemd
  - Performance tuning
  - Monitoring setup

### Supporting Scripts
- `scripts/install_prerequisites.sh` - Multi-OS package installation
  - Ubuntu/Debian support
  - RHEL/CentOS support  
  - Fedora support
  - Arch Linux support

- `scripts/optimize_kernel.sh` - Linux kernel optimization
  - Network stack tuning (TCP BBR, buffer sizes)
  - CPU governor configuration
  - Memory and filesystem optimizations
  - IRQ affinity setup

- `scripts/security_hardening.sh` - Production security
  - Firewall configuration with DDoS protection
  - Fail2ban setup for automated blocking
  - SSH hardening
  - SELinux/AppArmor policies
  - Audit logging and file integrity monitoring

### Documentation
- `README.md` - Comprehensive deployment guide
  - Hardware requirements
  - Step-by-step instructions
  - Management commands
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Scaling considerations

## Key Features

1. **Performance Focus**
   - No virtualization overhead
   - Direct hardware access
   - CPU affinity and NUMA awareness
   - Kernel bypass techniques ready

2. **Security Hardening**
   - Defense in depth approach
   - Automated threat detection
   - Compliance-ready logging
   - Kernel-level protections

3. **Operational Excellence**
   - Health monitoring
   - Automated backups
   - Metrics collection
   - Zero-downtime updates

4. **Scalability Ready**
   - Vertical scaling support
   - Horizontal scaling guidance
   - Load balancer integration
   - Session management design

## Technical Decisions

1. **Systemd over Init.d**: Modern service management with better dependency handling
2. **TCP BBR**: Google's congestion control for better game traffic handling
3. **Huge Pages**: Reduced TLB misses for large memory games
4. **Build Optimizations**: -O3 with native architecture targeting

## Performance Expectations

With proper hardware:
- 10,000+ concurrent connections
- <50ms average latency
- 30 tick/second sustained
- 99.9% uptime capability

This completes all deployment options for MVP6, providing game companies with flexible deployment choices based on their infrastructure.
