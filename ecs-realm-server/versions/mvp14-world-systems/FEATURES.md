## Dynamic Spawning System

### Spawn Control Modes

- Shared spawn points with regular mobs
- Respawn timers (2-72 hours)

### Population Management

## Performance Considerations

### Server-Side
- Zone-based processing
- Update intervals: Weather (30s), Time (1s), Events (5s)
- Participant limits for events
- Spatial indexing for spawns

### Network Optimization
- Weather predictions reduce updates
- Time sync every 5 minutes
- Event state compression
- Delta updates for changes

### Scalability
- Instance-specific weather
- Configurable spawn limits
- Event queuing system
- Zone transfer handling
