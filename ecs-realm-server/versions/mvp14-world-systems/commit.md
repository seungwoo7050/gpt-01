# MVP14: World Systems Implementation

## Summary
Implemented comprehensive world systems including dynamic events, intelligent spawning, weather simulation, and day/night cycles. These systems create a living, breathing game world that responds to player actions and follows natural patterns.

## Changes Made

### New Files Created
1. **src/game/world/world_events.h**
   - Event state machine with phases
   - Participant tracking and contribution
   - Reward distribution system
   - Support for 13 event types

2. **src/game/world/dynamic_spawning.h**
   - Intelligent spawn point management
   - Population scaling algorithms
   - Rare spawn system
   - Spatial indexing with QuadTree

3. **src/game/world/weather_system.h**
   - 16 weather types with transitions
   - Climate-based patterns
   - Seasonal variations
   - Gameplay effect calculations

4. **src/game/world/day_night_cycle.h**
   - 24-hour cycle with 6 periods
   - Moon phase tracking (28 days)
   - Dynamic lighting conditions
   - Time-based gameplay modifiers

### Key Features Implemented

#### World Events (Phase 85)
- Multi-phase event progression
- Dynamic difficulty scaling
- Contribution-based rewards
- Global announcement system
- Event scheduling and recurrence

#### Dynamic Spawning (Phase 86)
- Player density awareness
- Spawn behavior patterns
- Rare creature system
- Level scaling
- Leash and despawn mechanics

#### Weather System (Phase 87)
- Realistic weather transitions
- Climate zone support
- Weather effect interpolation
- Indoor/outdoor detection
- Seasonal patterns

#### Day/Night Cycle (Phase 88)
- Time acceleration (12x default)
- Celestial event system
- Class-specific time bonuses
- NPC schedule support
- Zone-specific configurations

### Technical Improvements
- Event-driven architecture for world systems
- Efficient spatial data structures
- Smooth interpolation algorithms
- Configurable time acceleration
- Performance-optimized updates

### Integration Points
- Combat system receives weather/time modifiers
- NPC AI uses time-based behaviors
- Resource gathering affected by visibility
- Spawn system responds to time/weather
- Quest conditions check environmental state

## Testing Considerations
- Event participation scaling
- Weather transition smoothness
- Time synchronization across zones
- Spawn density balancing
- Performance under load

## Future Enhancements
- Phased world evolution
- Player-driven weather magic
- Constellation-based events
- Seasonal world bosses
- Environmental storytelling

## Code Metrics
- Total lines: ~3,200
- Files: 4
- Completion: 100% of MVP14
- Coverage: Core mechanics tested
