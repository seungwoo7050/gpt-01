# MVP14: World Systems

## Overview
This version implements dynamic world systems that make the game world feel alive and responsive. These systems create emergent gameplay through environmental interactions and temporal changes.

## Completed Phases (85-88)

### Phase 85: World Events
- Dynamic event system with multiple phases
- Player contribution tracking
- Scalable rewards based on participation
- Event types: Seasonal, World Boss, Invasion, Community Goals
- Zone-wide and global event support

### Phase 86: Dynamic Spawning
- Intelligent creature population control
- Player density-based scaling
- Rare spawn system with announcements
- Patrol routes and behavior patterns
- Resource node respawning

### Phase 87: Weather System
- 16 weather types with smooth transitions
- Climate-based weather patterns
- Seasonal variations
- Gameplay effects (movement, visibility, combat)
- Indoor/outdoor detection

### Phase 88: Day/Night Cycle
- 24-hour cycle with 6 time periods
- Moon phases (28-day cycle)
- Dynamic lighting and shadows
- Time-based gameplay modifiers
- Celestial events (eclipses, aurora)

## Key Features

### Environmental Interactions
- Weather affects combat (rain reduces fire damage)
- Night increases stealth effectiveness
- Fishing is better at dawn/dusk
- Herbs are more visible during day
- Mining nodes sparkle more at night

### NPC Scheduling
- Day/night activity patterns
- Weather-based behavior changes
- Shops open/close based on time
- Guard patrol changes

### Dynamic Content
- World bosses spawn at specific times
- Rare creatures appear during certain weather
- Seasonal events automatically trigger
- Community goals track server-wide progress

## Technical Highlights

### Performance Optimizations
- Spatial indexing for spawn areas (QuadTree)
- Event participant caching
- Weather transition interpolation
- Time-based modifier precalculation

### Scalability
- Zone-based weather/time management
- Configurable spawn densities
- Event participant limits
- LOD support for effects

### Integration Points
- Combat system (weather/time modifiers)
- NPC AI (scheduling, behavior)
- Resource gathering (visibility, rates)
- Quest system (time/weather conditions)

## Configuration Examples

### World Event
```cpp
WorldEventDefinition world_boss;
world_boss.event_name = "Ragnaros Awakens";
world_boss.type = WorldEventType::WORLD_BOSS;
world_boss.min_players = 20;
world_boss.phases = {clear_path, summon_boss, defeat_boss};
```

### Dynamic Spawning
```cpp
SpawnPoint wolf_spawn;
wolf_spawn.creature_ids = {1001, 1002}; // Young Wolf, Mangy Wolf
wolf_spawn.population_mode = PopulationMode::DYNAMIC;
wolf_spawn.scale_with_players = true;
```

### Weather Configuration
```cpp
ZoneWeatherConfig config;
config.climate = ClimateType::TEMPERATE;
config.has_seasons = true;
config.can_have_storms = true;
```

### Day/Night Settings
```cpp
ZoneDayNightConfig daynight;
daynight.day_length_hours = 2.0f; // 2 real hours = 24 game hours
daynight.time_acceleration = 12.0f;
daynight.has_aurora = true; // Northern zones
```

## Development Stats
