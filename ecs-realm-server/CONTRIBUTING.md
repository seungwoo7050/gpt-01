## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under **Issues**.
- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, **open a new one**. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Open a new issue and provide a clear and detailed explanation of the feature you would like to see, why it is useful, and any implementation ideas.

### Pull Requests

1.  Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  Ensure the test suite passes (`make unit_tests && ./unit_tests`).
4.  Make sure your code lints. Follow the existing coding style.
5.  Issue that pull request!
