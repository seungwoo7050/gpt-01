// [SEQUENCE: MVP7-14] MapManager implementation
// Note: The implementation for MapManager is currently minimal as the core logic
// resides within the header for this MVP. Further logic would be moved here
// in subsequent refactoring.

// This space is intentionally left for the implementation of methods
// declared in map_manager.h if they were more complex. For now, most
// logic is inline in the header for simplicity.
