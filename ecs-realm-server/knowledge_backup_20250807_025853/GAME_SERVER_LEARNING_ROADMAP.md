## 💡 Expert Learning Strategies

### Effective Learning Methods
1. **실습 우선**: Every theory must be immediately implemented
2. **성능 측정**: All optimizations must be benchmarked
3. **코드 리뷰**: Study production game server codebases
4. **커뮤니티 참여**: Contribute to open-source game projects
5. **점진적 복잡성**: Start simple, add complexity systematically

### Reference Game Servers for Study
- **Open Source**: [TrinityCore](https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore), [MaNGOS](https://github.com/mangos/MaNGOS)
- **Architecture Study**: World of Warcraft, EVE Online server architecture
- **Performance Cases**: High-frequency trading systems, CDN architectures

### Production Readiness Validation
- **Load Testing**: Apache JMeter, k6, custom client simulators
- **Security Audit**: OWASP testing, penetration testing
- **Performance Profiling**: Intel VTune, perf, Flamegraphs
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack
