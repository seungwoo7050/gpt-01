# MVP7: Load Testing Plan

## Overview
Comprehensive load testing to validate the server can handle 5,000+ concurrent players as specified in requirements.

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Connection Stress Test
**Goal**: Verify server can handle 5,000+ simultaneous connections

```cpp
// Test parameters
- Ramp up: 100 connections/second
- Target: 5,000 concurrent connections
- Duration: 30 minutes
- Metrics: Connection success rate, memory per connection
```

### 2. Login Storm Test
**Goal**: Handle massive login spike (server restart scenario)

```cpp
// Test parameters
- 5,000 clients attempt login within 60 seconds
- Measure authentication throughput
- Monitor database connection pool
```

### 3. Movement Stress Test
**Goal**: Process real-time movement updates

```cpp
// Test parameters
- 5,000 players moving continuously
- 10 movement updates/second per player
- Total: 50,000 packets/second
- Monitor spatial indexing performance
```

### 4. Combat Load Test
**Goal**: Validate combat system under load

```cpp
// Test parameters
- 1,000 simultaneous combat sessions
- Mix of targeted and action combat
- Skill usage patterns from real games
- Monitor damage calculation performance
```

### 5. Guild War Simulation
**Goal**: Large-scale battle performance

```cpp
// Test parameters
- 200 vs 200 guild war
- All players in same area
- Heavy skill usage
- Monitor server tick stability
```

### 6. Hotspot Test
**Goal**: Handle player concentration

```cpp
// Test parameters
- 1,000 players in single grid cell
- Stress spatial query system
- Monitor broadcast performance
```

### 7. Endurance Test
**Goal**: Long-term stability

```cpp
// Test parameters
- 72 hours continuous operation
- 3,000 average concurrent users
- Monitor memory leaks
- Check performance degradation
```

## Metrics to Collect

- Memory usage (RSS, heap, stack)
- Network bandwidth (in/out)
- Packet processing latency
- Server tick time (target: 33ms)
- Database query times

### Application Metrics
- Active connections
- Packets per second
- Login success rate
- Combat calculations per second
- Spatial queries per second
- ECS update time

### Client Experience Metrics
- Connection time
- Login response time
- Movement latency
- Combat action latency
- Packet loss rate
- Disconnection rate

## Test Infrastructure

### Hardware Requirements
- Load Generator: 8 core, 32GB RAM
- Network: 10Gbps connection
- Monitoring: Separate server

### Software Stack
- Load Test Framework: Custom C++ client
- Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana
- Analysis: Python scripts for data processing

## Success Criteria

### Performance Targets
- ✓ 5,000+ concurrent connections
- ✓ <50ms average response time
- ✓ <100ms P95 response time
- ✓ 30 FPS server tick rate maintained
- ✓ <16GB memory for 5,000 players
- ✓ Zero memory leaks over 72 hours

### Stability Targets
- ✓ No crashes during test period
- ✓ <0.1% packet loss
- ✓ <0.01% unexpected disconnections
- ✓ Graceful degradation under overload

## Test Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Individual Tests (Week 1)
1. Run each test scenario independently
2. Identify bottlenecks
3. Apply initial optimizations

### Phase 2: Combined Tests (Week 2)
1. Mix multiple scenarios
2. Simulate realistic player behavior
3. Test error recovery

### Phase 3: Optimization (Week 3)
1. Profile hotspots
2. Optimize critical paths
3. Retest problem areas

### Phase 4: Final Validation (Week 4)
1. Full 72-hour endurance test
2. Document results
3. Create performance report

## Bottleneck Predictions

Based on architecture analysis:

1. **Spatial System**: Hotspot scenarios may stress grid cells
2. **Combat System**: AOE calculations in large battles
3. **Network Layer**: Broadcast storms in crowded areas
4. **Database**: Login storms may exhaust connection pool
5. **Memory**: Entity pooling may need tuning

## Optimization Strategies

### Quick Wins
- Connection pooling tuning
- Packet batching
- Spatial query caching

### Medium Term
- Lock-free data structures
- SIMD optimizations
- Memory pool sizing

### Long Term
